How to get the rms_UDP.py to run on Mac OS:

Install all the dependencies:

1. Download and install the latest python Version from python.org for OS X  I used 3.8.2 to develop the app.
2. pip3 install carreralib
3. pip3 install pyqt5
4. Install the latest XCode

Create a new project in XCode and add main.swift and ServerConnection.swift to the project
Compile and start the Bluetooth Network Server
Once you turn on the CU and it finds it, the BT server will automatically connect to it

Run the rms.  It should establish a UDP connection to the Bluetooth server over UDP through the localhost interface on port 8888

prompt>python3 rms_UDP.py

The code itself is still pretty wild as this needed some reconfiguration from the Linux bluetooth version and 
I was in the process of learning swift to get access to the bluetooth and network stack on a Mac with macOS 10.15


How to get the rms.py to run on Linux:

This is based on a Ubuntu Distribution

Install all the dependencies:

1. apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
2. apt-get install python3-pip
3. pip3 install carreralib
4. pip3 install setuptools
5. pip3 install bluepy
6. pip3 install pyqt5


Starting the Application:

Get the CU BT Address with the command:
prompt> hcitool lescan


Start the RMS with the CU Address as a command line option:
prompt> python3 rms.py <CU BT Address>

or

prompt> python3 rms.py
and input the CU BT Address in the Window that pops up
or select the CU with a mouse Click in case QtBluetooth is working properly

Happy Slotting
